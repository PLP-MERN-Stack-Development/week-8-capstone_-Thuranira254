# MERN Stack Capstone Project

This project is a comprehensive Health & Fitness Tracker built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The application allows users to track and visualize their health data, including steps, weight, calories, sleep, and workouts. Users can view trends over time, analyze their progress with interactive charts, and see summary statistics for each metric.

Key features include:
- User-friendly dashboard for tracking daily health metrics
- Interactive analytics with charts and trend analysis
- Filtering by metric and time range (last 7, 30, 90 days, or all time)
- Summary statistics (average, maximum, minimum) for each health metric
- Responsive design for use on any device

The backend is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, providing a RESTful API for storing and retrieving health data. The frontend is developed with React and Tailwind CSS, offering a modern and intuitive user experience.
